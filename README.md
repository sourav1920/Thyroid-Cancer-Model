*Thyroid Cancer Model*
Project Report  
Abstract
The project aimed to analyze data related to thyroid cancer patients to predict the recurrence of cancer. Various machine learning algorithms were employed for this purpose, including Random Forest Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors Regression. The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting spelling mistakes, and encoding categorical variables. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Accuracy.

Introduction:
Thyroid cancer recurrence is a significant concern for patients and clinicians. This project addresses the need for accurate prediction of recurrence using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to patient demographics, medical history, and tumor characteristics. The objective is to develop models that can effectively predict cancer recurrence based on these features. The methodology involves data preprocessing, model training using multiple algorithms, and performance evaluation.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The dataset was collected from a reliable source and initially examined for its structure and missing values. Missing values were replaced with mode values after identifying them for respective columns. Duplicate rows were removed, and spelling mistakes in the 'Pathology' column were corrected. Categorical variables were encoded, and unnecessary columns were dropped.
 
Methodology:
Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors Regression were chosen for their suitability for the predictive task. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Models were trained, validated, and evaluated using appropriate metrics. Parameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.

Results:
Experimental results showed that Random Forest Regression achieved the highest accuracy among the models evaluated. Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error were calculated for each model to assess prediction accuracy. Visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps were used to illustrate key findings and correlations between features.

Discussion:
The results indicate that machine learning models can effectively predict thyroid cancer recurrence based on patient data. The strengths and weaknesses of each model were analyzed, and insights were provided into areas for further improvement. A comparison with prior work demonstrated the contribution of the project to existing knowledge in the field.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the project successfully developed machine learning models for predicting thyroid cancer recurrence. The objectives were achieved, and the models demonstrated promising performance. Recommendations for future work include exploring additional features, optimizing model parameters further, and validating the models on larger datasets.
